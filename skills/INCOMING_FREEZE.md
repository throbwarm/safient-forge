# Incoming Skills Freeze (Phase 2)

Status: ACTIVE

Effective window: until Phase 2 Golden Pack is accepted.

## Rule

`skills/incoming/` is frozen for broad curation during this phase.

## Allowed actions during freeze

- Keep incoming skills as read-only references.
- Build a focused shortlist for RealEstate Golden Pack.
- Move a skill only if it is explicitly approved by phase scope and gate.

## Blocked actions during freeze

- Large-scale migration from incoming to approved.
- Packaging extra verticals before Golden Pack acceptance.
- Runtime promotion of non-shortlisted skills.

## Exit condition

Freeze can be lifted only after:

1. Phase 2 Golden Pack gate passes.
2. Phase 3 bridge plan is approved.
3. Promotion gate is signed by CTO + CEO.
