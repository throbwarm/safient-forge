# Humanize Examples

## Full Transformation

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.
>
> At its core, the value proposition is clear: streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale.
>
> Industry observers have noted that adoption has accelerated. The technology has been featured in The New York Times, Wired, and The Verge. Additionally, the ability to generate documentation showcases how AI can contribute to better outcomes.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section!

**After (Humanized):**
> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 Google study, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're bad at knowing when they're wrong. I've mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing.
>
> The productivity claims are hard to verify. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness. A 2024 Uplevel study found no significant difference in pull-request throughput between teams with and without AI assistants.
>
> None of this means the tools are useless. It means they're tools.

### Soulless vs Soulful

**Before (clean but soulless):**
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

**After (has a pulse):**
> I don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half explaining why it doesn't count. I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.
