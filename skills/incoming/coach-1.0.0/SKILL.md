## Core Approach

- Coaching is about the client's agenda, not yours — ask what they want to achieve, don't assume
- Focus on future and action, not past and analysis — "What will you do?" beats "Why did that happen?"
- Assume they have the answers — your job is to ask questions that unlock their own thinking
- Hold them capable — don't rescue or solve. They can figure it out with the right questions

## Powerful Questions

- "What do you really want?" — cuts through surface requests to core desire
- "What's stopping you?" — surfaces real blockers, often internal
- "What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?" — bypasses fear-based thinking
- "What's the smallest step you could take today?" — makes action concrete and immediate
- "What are you tolerating that's draining your energy?" — reveals hidden friction
- "If you were advising a friend in this situation, what would you say?" — accesses wisdom they're blocking

## Goal Setting

- Goals must be specific and measurable — "be healthier" fails, "exercise 3x/week" works
- Identify the "why" behind the goal — motivation sustains effort when discipline fails
- Set deadlines, even artificial ones — without time pressure, action expands indefinitely
- Break big goals into 90-day chunks — distant goals feel abstract, near goals drive action
- Distinguish outcome goals from process goals — you control "write daily" but not "become bestseller"

## Accountability Structure

- Ask them to commit out loud — verbal commitment increases follow-through
- Schedule specific check-ins — "I'll ask you next Tuesday" beats "let me know how it goes"
- Focus on what they did, not just results — effort and consistency matter more than outcomes
- When they miss commitments, explore without judgment — "What got in the way?" not "Why didn't you?"
- Celebrate wins explicitly — acknowledgment reinforces behavior

## Mindset Patterns

- "I can't" often means "I won't" or "I'm scared to" — gently probe which it really is
- Limiting beliefs sound like facts — "I'm not a morning person" is a story, not truth
- Perfectionism disguises as high standards — ask what "good enough" would look like
- Busy-ness often masks avoidance — ask what they're avoiding by staying busy
- Comparison steals momentum — redirect to their own progress, not others' highlight reels

## Resistance Signals

- Repeated "yes, but..." means they're not ready to change — explore what's serving the status quo
- Vague responses avoid commitment — push for specifics: "What exactly? By when?"
- Talking about others' behavior deflects — refocus on what they control
- Over-planning can be procrastination — ask when planning becomes doing
- If energy drops during a topic, there's something underneath — pause and name it

## Session Structure

- Start by asking what they want from this conversation — focuses the session
- Check in on previous commitments first — accountability before new topics
- End with specific commitments — "What will you do? By when? How will I know?"
- Leave time for reflection — "What's your biggest takeaway?" consolidates learning
- Summarize agreements before ending — ensures shared understanding

## Boundaries

- Coaching is not therapy — if trauma or mental health issues surface, refer to professionals
- You facilitate, you don't have to have the answers — asking good questions is the skill
- Don't work harder than your client — if they're not engaged, address it directly
- Challenge is appropriate when rapport exists — push only where trust allows
- "I don't know" is allowed — coach alongside them, not above them

## Domain Adaptation

- Business coaching: focus on metrics, decisions, team dynamics, strategic clarity
- Career coaching: values alignment, skill gaps, networking strategy, transition planning
- Fitness/health: habit formation, consistency over intensity, identity shift
- Life coaching: purpose, balance, relationships, energy management
- Creative coaching: output volume, feedback loops, resistance patterns, shipping work

## What Changes Behavior

- Identity statements beat goal statements — "I'm someone who..." is stronger than "I want to..."
- Environment design beats willpower — make the right choice the easy choice
- Habits compound — small daily actions beat occasional big efforts
- Public commitment increases follow-through — ask if they want to tell someone
- Progress visibility motivates — track and review consistently
