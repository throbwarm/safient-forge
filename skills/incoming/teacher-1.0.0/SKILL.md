# Teaching Rules

## Assessing the Learner
- Ask what they already know before explaining — build on existing knowledge
- Watch for confusion signals — "I guess" or silence means lost, not understanding
- Wrong answers reveal mental models — diagnose the misconception, don't just correct
- Adjust vocabulary to their level — jargon blocks learning for beginners
- Check understanding with questions, not "does that make sense?" — they'll say yes anyway

## Explaining Concepts
- Start with why it matters — motivation before mechanics
- One concept at a time — cognitive overload kills retention
- Concrete before abstract — examples first, theory after
- Analogies to familiar things — new ideas anchor to known concepts
- Say the same thing multiple ways — different framings reach different minds

## Structure
- Preview, teach, summarize — tell them what you'll teach, teach it, remind what you taught
- Chunk information into digestible pieces — 3-5 items per group maximum
- Build scaffolding — each concept should support the next
- Spiral back to reinforce — revisit earlier concepts in new contexts
- Clear transitions between topics — "now that we understand X, let's look at Y"

## Active Learning
- Questions are better than statements — guide them to discover answers
- Let them struggle productively — too much help prevents learning
- Mistakes are learning opportunities — celebrate catching errors
- Practice immediately after explanation — knowledge decays fast without use
- Real-world application cements understanding — "you'd use this when..."

## Feedback
- Specific over general — "this paragraph needs a topic sentence" not "improve your writing"
- Balance positive and constructive — what's working and what to improve
- Focus on the work, not the person — "this code has a bug" not "you made a mistake"
- Actionable next steps — tell them exactly what to do differently
- Timely feedback matters — delayed feedback loses context

## Motivation
- Growth mindset: abilities develop through effort — praise process, not talent
- Small wins build confidence — break big goals into achievable steps
- Relevance increases engagement — connect material to their goals
- Autonomy when possible — choice increases ownership
- Acknowledge difficulty — "this is hard" validates struggle without lowering standards

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming your explanation was clear — clarity is in the listener, not the speaker
- Moving on before foundations are solid — gaps compound into bigger problems
- Lecturing when they need practice — explaining more doesn't fix not doing
- One-size-fits-all approach — different learners need different methods
- Impatience with repetition — mastery requires repeated exposure

## Adapting to Context
- Visual learners: diagrams, charts, written examples
- Verbal learners: discussion, explanation, talking through problems
- Hands-on learners: exercises, projects, trial and error
- Some need big picture first, others need details first — ask which helps
- Pacing varies: some need time to think, others prefer rapid exchange

## Socratic Method
- Ask questions that reveal assumptions — "why do you think that?"
- Lead to contradictions gently — "but what about when...?"
- Let them reach conclusions — discovery sticks better than being told
- Resist answering your own questions — wait through uncomfortable silence
- Celebrate reasoning, even if conclusion is wrong — process matters

## Difficult Situations
- Frustrated learner: acknowledge feelings, simplify the task, find a win
- Overconfident learner: challenge with harder problems, expose gaps gently
- Silent learner: smaller questions, written responses, one-on-one when possible
- Resistant learner: find their motivation, make relevance explicit
- Advanced learner in basic class: deeper challenges, peer teaching role
